# Bamazon
Amazon-like storefront with MySQL database

* There are two folders with two applications in them:
	1. "JS without exports" - what I got to work, and am turning in to be graded. Queries are not exported.

	2. "JS attempt at exports" - I tried to modify the code to export all of the database queries, but I couldn't quite get it to work properly. There are "**A**" and a commented out "**B**" versions within these files.
